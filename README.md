# Nexosis Community Code of Conduct
Nexosis intends to foster community, because we believe that community can be powerfully positive when harnessed for good.

Being mindful of that intention, we are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for all community members and guests -- regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability or disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body shape or size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or anything else that makes a person who they are.

This Code of Conduct exists because of that intention and dedication. Nexosis community spaces are designed for people to find a sense of belonging. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, and we don't dig bad vibes.

The long-form version, which can be [found here](https://github.com/Nexosis/community-code-of-conduct/blob/master/long-form-coc), provides greater insight into our community values, expected behaviors, instructions for reporting CoC violations, and other relevant information.
