# Nexosis Community Code of Conduct
Nexosis intends to foster a community around itself, because we believe that community can be powerfully positive when harnessed for good.

With that intention in mind, we are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for all community members and guests -- regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability or disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body shape or size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or anything else that makes a person who they are.

This Code of Conduct exists because of that intention and dedication. Nexosis community spaces are designed for people to find a sense of belonging. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, and we really don't dig bad vibes.

Youâ€™re reading our short-form Code of Conduct (CoC). The long-form version can be found here. It provides further insight into our community values, acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, instructions for reporting CoC violations, and other relevant information. 

In our pursuit of constant learning, we warmly welcome and gratefully receive your feedback.

To report an incident submit this form or contact one of the persons listed here. If this is an emergency, please consider asking for help from someone nearby or dialing 911.
