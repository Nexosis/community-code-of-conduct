##Short Form Code of Conduct
As a company, technology provider, and, most importantly, a group of humans, Nexosis intends to foster a community around itself, because we believe that community can be powerfully positive when harnessed for good.

With that intention in mind, we are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for all community members and guests -- regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability or disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body shape or size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or anything else that makes a person who they are.

This Code of Conduct exists because of that intention and dedication. Nexosis community spaces are designed for people to find a sense of belonging. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, and we really don't dig bad vibes.

##Values 
The guiding principles, in which the Nexosis community is rooted: 
*Inclusion -- sincerely believing that everyone matters
*Curiosity -- learning and teaching, to grow personally and professionally  
*Helpful -- supporting those who have expressed a need
*Selfless -- considering the interests of others rather than solely one’s own

#Spaces
The Nexosis Community Code of Conduct code applies to all Nexosis Community spaces -- both online and offline -- including the Nexosis Facebook page, Nexosis open source software repositories, Nexosis-hosted events, as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to Nexosis Community business. Participants in our community who violate our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of Nexosis Community moderators.

Some Nexosis Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all participants in the Nexosis Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences for all. 

Noncompliance with the Code of Conduct, may lead to a discussion with community moderators, mediation with other participant(s) involved, expulsion from a particular community space, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community all together.
