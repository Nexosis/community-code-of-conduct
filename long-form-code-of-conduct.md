# Long Form Code of Conduct
Nexosis intends to foster community around itself, as a company, technology provider, and, most importantly, as a group of humans...because we believe that community can be powerfully positive when harnessed for good.

We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for all community members and guests -- regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability or disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body shape or size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or anything else that makes a person who they are.

This Code of Conduct exists because of that intention and dedication. Nexosis community spaces are designed for people to find a sense of belonging. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, and we don't dig bad vibes.

## Values 
The guiding principles, in which the Nexosis community is rooted: 
* Inclusion -- sincerely believing that everyone matters
* Curiosity -- learning and teaching, to grow personally and professionally  
* Helpful -- supporting those who have expressed a need
* Selfless -- considering the interests of others rather than solely one’s own

## Spaces
The Nexosis Community Code of Conduct code applies to all Nexosis Community spaces -- both online and offline -- including the Nexosis Facebook page, Nexosis open source software repositories, Nexosis-hosted events, as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to Nexosis Community business. Participants in our community who violate our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of Nexosis Community moderators.

Some Nexosis Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all participants in the Nexosis Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences for all. 

Noncompliance with the Code of Conduct, may lead to a discussion with community moderators, mediation with other participant(s) involved, expulsion from a particular community space, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community all together.

## Behavior
Appropriate behavior contributes to the health, safety, and longevity of the Nexosis Community and includes:
* Participating in an authentic and empathetic way.
* Representing the Nexosis Community in a positive, professional way.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Exercising consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Refraining from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Being mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* Considering what is best for the community.
* Alerting community moderators if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or unresolved violations of this Code of Conduct.
* Refraining from doing something you wouldn’t do in another professional situation.
* Remembering that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; being respectful to all patrons of these locations.
* Keeping an open and curious mind without making assumptions about others.
* Attempting collaboration before conflict.
* Gracefully accepting well-communicated constructive criticism.

Inappropriate behavior (harassment) includes:
* Discriminatory language and actions that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers.
* Excessive trolling or sustained, uninvited disruption.
* Insults or personal attacks.
* Violent or personally objectifying material.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Violent language or threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming unprofessional levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent.
* Threatening to post or posting other people’s personally identifiable information without consent.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent.
* Blogging, tweeting, or otherwise communicating with intent to harm someone’s reputation, i.e., “making an example” of a community participant.
* Intimidation, stalking, or following.
* Harassing or unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Incident Reporting
:point-right: See [these procedures](https://github.com/Nexosis/community-code-of-conduct/blob/master/incident-reporting.md) for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately, even if participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.

If a participant violates the Code of Conduct, community moderators may take any action they deem appropriate in the pursuit of maintaining a welcoming environment for all participants, up to and including expulsion from an event and/or the community and identification of the participant as a violator. If a community moderator is not available at an event, the event organizer should ask violators to leave and then report the situation to community moderators for further deliberation.

There will always be at least one moderator “on-call” if no moderators are able to attend an event. Community moderators and/or event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting or making an environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to respect the Code of Conduct in all Nexosis communities and at all Nexosis or Nexosis-related events.

## Moderators
Code of Conduct moderators will:
* Be at least two people (wherever/whenever possible) working together to respond to violations.
* Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
* Make an effort to understand both sides of the situation, including talking to affected participants and reading up on the underlying issues, particularly if they don’t have similar personal experience(s).
* Keep each other accountable.
* Trade off duties as needed.
* Recuse themselves or be excused from handling an incident if they are listed as a possible Code of Conduct violator.
* Be identified (with up-to-date information) in the Nexosis Community Moderators list 

## Additional Items
Please note:
* Moderators can choose to close discussion threads or ask for a subject change.
* Moderators can choose to re-evaluate consequences.
* Do not delete posts or comments you’ve made unless:
 * You sincerely made the post in error (like accidentally posting in the wrong group, for example) and
 * Deleting will not interfere with group discussion. The specific problem we want to address with this rule: Deleting because the conversation has become tense or uncomfortable or to avoid taking responsibility. Many of us are socialized or naturally prone to avoid conflict, but working through that conflict and acknowledging differing viewpoints is worth the discomfort.
* This Code of Conduct applies to Nexosis Community spaces and events, but if you are being or have been harassed by a Nexosis Community participant externally, you may still report to the Nexosis Community moderators. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community participants seriously. The Nexosis Community moderators reserve the right to exclude people from the Nexosis Community and/or Nexosis events based on past and/or external behavior towards Nexosis Community participants or non-participants.
* We will not name harassment victims without their consent. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Nexosis Community and/or the general public.

## Feedback on this Code of Conduct
With our value of curiosity at heart, feedback is always appreciated. You can submit feedback by creating an issue or submitting a pull request in this Github repository or by completing and submitting [this form](https://goo.gl/ZyXtah).

The Nexosis Community Code of Conduct is a living document. It will evolve with the Nexosis Community and ensure that we provide a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, with awareness and mindfulness toward the ever-changing realities around us.
